Notice!

We'll have two databases in this project. One for real looking dev data and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: 
.env.test and .env.development. 

Into .env.test add "PGDATABASE= nc_news_test"
Into .env.development add "PGDATABASE= nc_news"
